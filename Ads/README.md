This program provides an implementation of a class CBigInt for performing operations on arbitrarily large integers, overcoming the size limitations of primitive integer types in C++.

Features
Support for Arbitrary Size:

Handles integers of arbitrary length, both positive and negative.
Can be initialized from strings, integers, or vectors of digits.
Arithmetic Operations:

Addition (+, +=).
Subtraction (-).
Multiplication (*, *=).
Comparison Operators:

Equal (==), Not Equal (!=).
Less Than (<), Less Than or Equal (<=).
Greater Than (>), Greater Than or Equal (>=).
Input and Output:

Supports formatted input and output using >> and << operators.
Error Handling:

Validates input for proper numeric format and throws exceptions for invalid input.
Hexadecimal Support (Placeholder):

A placeholder function for potential hexadecimal representation comparison.
